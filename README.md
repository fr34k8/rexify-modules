#Rex modules

[Rex](http://rexify.com) (*RE*mote e*X*ecution) is a lightweight *Deployment*, 
*Configuration Management* and *Automation* tool. It is ideal for small and 
large businesses as well. It uses SSH as authentication and transport layer 
thus it can be set up pretty quick.


*If one has to do a task more than once, it must be automated!*
